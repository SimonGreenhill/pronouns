-gu;;1sg_o;1st singular transitive object;;;;kili1267;The possessive pronouns form two classes, the first class marks an "intermediate degree of possession" and the second class marks a "more distant degree of possession". (Senft 1986:49) Most forms drawn from Senft 1986. O forms and paradigm checked in Lawton 1993. Subject free forms here are emphatic, subject more typically expressed by bound pronoun. Third person forms are demonstratives, and rarely used with pronominal function in discourse.
