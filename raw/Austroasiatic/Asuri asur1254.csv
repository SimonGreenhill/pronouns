iŋ,,1sg_s,1st singular intransitive subject,,"General note regarding alignment (a and s). Hahn lists a single column for 'nominative' which is presumably both A and S, and forms have been entered on the basis of this assumption",,asur1254,Hahn1901

alaŋ,,12du_a,1st dual inclusive transitive subject,,"There is clearly an inclusive distinction, though in parts of his exposition Hahn treats this as a 'second form of the second person' rather than of the first person, and his translation of the inclusive duals is slightly odd 'I and you two' despite being in the dual column. However it seems likely that the 'two' has semantic scope over the whole group, not just the 'you', and the data has been coded on that assumption",,asur1254,Hahn1901
