105	105	Martuthunira			Martuthunira mart1255.csv		mart1255	Free	Louise Baird	The third person plural pronoun has the very restricted function of serving as a definite anaphor for plural noun phrases. It refers to a group of entities already established in text and specifically implies that the membership of that group has not changed. This emphasis on no change in group membership is unimportant for anaphoric reference to noun phrases denoting individuals (singular) or pairs of individuals (duals) and it is thus not surprising that pularna has no singular or dual counterparts." p103 Demonstratives are used for 3sg reference.

128	128	Amele			Amele amel1241.csv		amel1241	Free	Louise Baird	The forms given here in for the possessive paradigm are the ones used for alienable possession. Alienable possession is expressed by a possessive noun phrase (...) which comprises a possessed nominal preceded by a possessive postpositional phrase. The postposition is na 'of' and this can follow either a pronoun or a nominal if it is a name or kinship term" (Roberts 1987: 171). The forms of the suffixes for inalienable possession depend on the grammatical class of the noun (ibid.: 172). "inalienably possessed nouns, mainly kinship and body part terms, are suffixed for person and number of the possessor and, in the case of the kinship nouns, also for singular or plural number of the possessee." (ibid.: 139)

134	134	Western Dani			Western Dani west2594.csv		west2594	Free	Louise Baird	Possession is marked by adding pronominal prefixes to nouns. There are four different classes which vary according to the initial sound of the noun. (Barclay 2008: 66).
135	135	Bunaq			Bunaq buna1278.csv		buna1278	Free	Louise Baird	"Note that there is no 3rd singular personal pronoun; demonstratives are used in this role." (Schapper 2009: 90). The animate form of the non-proximal demonstrative is used to track 3sg referents. It has been included here in the paradigm to fill all cells.  The possessive pronouns given are for alienable possession. About inalienable possession: (Schapper 2009: 321) "In Bunaq possessive relations of this [=inalienble] kind are denoted by compounding. The possessor of an inalienable possessor compound always precedes the possessum. Inalienable possessors can be realised in a variety of ways by prefixes on the possessum; six different classes are recognised on the basis of the inflectional options they show in the 3rd person (...). 1st persons and 2nd persons are predictable across classes.

(Heeschen 1998: 148). The free personal pronouns rarely occur as object pronouns. (...) First of all, they co-occur with, and are replaced by, the set of object pronouns, which are non-final suffixes of the verb, and secondly, they are condensed structures, which onlly make sense if the proper object pronouns alon or the co-occurrence of the free pronouns and the proper object pronouns have established unequivocal reference.

The free pronouns took case marking just like nouns, including ergative case marking when subject of a transitive verb. The free pronouns use for the subject of an intransitive predicate and the bound pronouns used for all subjects are displayed in Table 16." p37 Based on this, the A forms have been entered as per the S forms plus ergative case marking. Dual and plural O forms are not covered in the source.

208	208	Adang			Adang adan1251.csv		adan1251	Free	Owen Edwards	Owen's cleaned up version. "The pronominal prefixes mark inalienable possession (Haan 2001: 38) and the objects of some verbs. Other verbs use the accusative free pronouns (with -ri) for their objects (ibid.: 46). As for the free pronouns that mark (alienable) possession, [s]emantically, both types of genitive pronouns express possession. The difference, however, is that a genitive pronoun marked e, while expressing possession, also expresses emphasis or contrast. I shall call it a 'contrastive' genitive pronoun. A genitive pronoun marked ɔ does not express emphasis or contrast. Therefore I call it a 'non-contrastive' genitive pronoun." (ibid.: 163).
209	209	Klon			Klon kelo1247.csv		kelo1247	Free	Owen Edwards	Owen's cleaned up version. Added dual A forms. "Klon has an agentive system, whereby Actor S arguments pattern the same way as A arguments, and Undergoer S arguments pattern the same way as O arguments. There is a small set of verbs that may take either SA or SO arguments dependent on the perceived semantic role of a referent in a particular context" (Baird 2008: 66).
210	210	Teiwa			Teiwa teiw1235.csv		teiw1235	Free	Owen Edwards	Owen's cleaned up version. Removed long A and S forms (focus) retained short forms (topic). Only retained syllabic forms (used before C initial roots). The paradigm below follows the following statement: "The object prefixes have animate referents (humans or animals), the object pronouns may be used to refer to both animate and inanimate objects" (Klamer 2010: 78). This does not entirely match, however, with Klamer's statement elsewhere: "For third person referents, a free pronoun is used if it is inanimate. If it is animate, it is expressed with a verbal prefix, and an optional additional NP." (ibid.: 166-167). The third person plural "[i]'in and gi'in refer to a group of people outside the physical and/or narrative context, translated as 'elsewhere' here. In practice, the use of these pronouns typically implies that the speaker cannot see the referents because they are at a different location, or existed at a different time." (ibid.: 79). "Teiwa has a set of dual pronouns that can be used to encode subjects and to conjoin nominals." (ibid.: 82). It seems, however, that the 'plural' forms are generally used to refer to two participants, hence their presence in the 'dual' boxes as well.  "Teiwa has two pronouns that refer to third person referents that are inanimate: the pronouns i 'it.place' refers to a location, and the pronoun in 'it, thing' refers to an entity." (ibid.: 85).
211	211	Fasu			Fasu fasu1242.csv		fasu1242	Free	Owen Edwards	Owen's cleaned up version. Removed first set of possessives (used for body parts). The first of the possessive forms is used for body parts, the second one for everything else.

Removed O forms that are also A and S forms, note that the other variants (i.e. yad/ad) are listed with no indication of either having a special use. All pronominal forms except the object forms may function alone as a nominal or as an attributive element within a noun phrase. The object forms may only function as free personal pronouns." (Davies 1981: 151).
213	213	Korowai			Korowai koro1312.csv		koro1312	Free	Owen Edwards	Owen's cleaned-up version. Removed forms without final /p/ [...] which is often dropped, especially in fast speech.

214	214	Mauwake			Mauwake mauw1238.csv		mauw1238	Free	Owen Edwards	Owen's cleaned up version. Removed non-genitive possessive pronouns as [...]the main strategy for expressing the possessor in a NP is to use either the genitive pronoun or a possessive noun phrase.
216	216	Mian			Mian mian1256.csv		mian1256	Free	Louise Baird	Owen's cleaned up version. Removed a lone /l/ series. Removed bound forms. Used male forms for 2nd and 3rd person. Retained only male froms for 2nd person. Gender 1 = male, Gender 2 = female
217	217	Usan			Usan usan1239.csv		usan1239	Free	Louise Baird	Owen's cleaned up version. Removed question marks. Arbitrarily chose only the longer object prefixes listed on p.51 of Reesink (1984). Given the way plural inanimate objects are conceived of as singular, the third person plural object prefix could never refer to inanimate objects, and the third person singular does not have an explicit object prefix. (Reesink 1987: 109) -- I assume that plural inanimate possessors are also referred to with a singular form (C vT). Objects are marked by object prefixes on verbs. There is no 3sg object prefix and therefore "The free third person singular pronoun may also fill the object position, but as such it is not a verbal prefix." (p51)
218	218	Sentani			Sentani nucl1632.csv		nucl1632	Free	Owen Edwards	Owen's cleaned up version. Only retained set II forms (p.16) as the others have more specific uses. In a footnote, Cowan (1965: 16) writes "I have included this "inclusive" form of the 1st p. du., pl., although it is not in general use and is probably a dialectal form adapted to this specialized end under Austronesian influence. (...) The seris II type of this pronoun (e) is put between brackets because I have never met it in actual usage, while my informants were divided in their opinions on the point." I hope I have interpreted Cowan (1965: 16) well as concerns the dəjɛ (etc) vs. the da (etc) series. The da series can be used with postpositions -- I do not know if they are obligatorily followed by postpositions when they are O.

Because, they're listed first. And I can't find any examples of the short possessive forms. Kooyers also gives two forms of the object suffix for pronouns -na and -n. I've arbitraily chosen the form -na on the assumption that the latter can be derived from the former, but not visa-versa. Masculine 2nd person forms entered.

Only the first is shown in the paradigm, but an example illustrating the contrast is: Direct: ŋai tama-g /I father-my/ 'my father'. Indirect: ŋai sa-g ab /I PCL-my house/ 'my house'.

Alternate forms for other pronouns are described in the notes for each entry. All possessive pronouns are formed through regular addition of the prefix /di-/, as such all patterns of variation observed in relation to the A, S and O forms also occur in the possessive forms (Lorenzino 1998:142-3). In addition to the forms listed below, the language also possesses an unmarked, impersonal pronoun /a/, meaning 'one, somebody', which can be used in both the singular and plural (Lorenzino 1998:150-5).

Note also that 'en' occurs as the 3sg pronoun in place of 'a' in cleft constructions, as complement of the copular and in emphatic contexts (Huttar and Huttar 1994:458-9). In addition, several regular phonological processes alter the form of many of the pronouns listed. The effects of these processes are described in the comments to each entry.

Mous (2003:1) thus describes Inner Mbugu as a 'parasite of Normal Mbugu'. Please note, it is unclear in Mous (2003) if the object pronouns listed actually serve this function and as such this part of the paradigm is subject to further revision. Description of non-human pronouns (if there are any) frustratingly absent, though the 3sg given is glossed only as he/she. (-Owen)

The set of personal suffixes is identical to the set of suffixed object forms listed below except that the 1sg form is '-i' as opposed to '-ni' (Holes 1990:170-1). The form  'maːl-' appears when the possessum is masculine while 'maːlat-' is used with a feminine possessum (Holes 1990:170-1). The forms incorporating 'maːl-' are listed below. In addition to this, an alternative independent possessive form may be constructed by suffixing the above mentioned personal suffixes to the stem 'ħagː-' which does not inflect for the gender of the possessum. Pronominal possession may also be expressed by direct suffixation of the personal suffixes to the possessed noun (Holes 1990:171).

309	309	Tuvaluan			Tuvaluan tuva1244.csv		tuva1244	Free	Louise Baird	Besnier (1999:264) states that case is marked on both nouns and pronouns through a system of prepositions and preposition-like particles. Given that these case marking elements are treated as independent words, the pronoun forms listed below are given without case markers. In addition to this, please note that the possessive pronouns of this language are complex elements constructed out of an article morpheme followed by an affix indicating possessive class (alienable vs. inalienable) which is in turn followed by a reduced personal pronoun suffix (Besnier 1999:399). Only the reduced personal pronoun suffixes are listed below. Free possessive pronouns are marked along several dimensions: the number and person of the possessor, for singular possessors there is a distinction between alienable and inalienable, and there is also a distinction made for whether the possessed is singular indefinite / singular definite / plural indefinite / plural indefinite. The different combination of these variables results in a more complex paradigm than is allowed for here, which is why the original person entering the data entered the bound forms.
310	310	Savosavo			Savosavo savo1255.csv		savo1255	Free	Louise Baird	The possessive forms listed all transparently display the suffix '-βa' and are used with singular, masculine and all dual and plural possessed nouns or nouns phrases. Where the possessum is singular and feminine the suffix '-βa' is replaced by     '-ma' (Wegener 2012:137).

Please note also, it is not always the case that a pronoun or noun functioning as the direct object of a verb appears inflected for the accusative case (Gorelova 2002:172). The primary function of the accusative case is to mark the direct object, however, and as no clear explanation of the conditioning factors determining whether a direct object appears in the accusative or not is given by Gorelova (1999), the accusative forms are listed below as the object pronouns.

Since the choice is based only on distance, and there is no gender distinction (here, unlike in the case of e.g. Tamil) the language is treated as having gender syncretisms and the same forms (the proximal) are entered for both genders.
321	321	Arbore			Arbore arbo1245.csv		arbo1245	Free	Louise Baird	A number of A and S forms in addition to those listed below exist that are obtained by the addition of various suffixes to the listed pronouns (Hayward 1984:215). The masculine predicative posessive forms are entered here.

With the third person, there are distinct proximate and distal forms, the distal forms are used here (since the presentation in the grammar implies they are the unmarked ones). Also, 3rd person nonsingular forms have a masc vs fem/neuter distinction; the masc forms are entered here. 
323	323	Hausa			Hausa haus1257.csv		haus1257	Free	Oscar McLoughlin-Ning	The forms below are given in the system of transcription adopted by Newman (2000). Also note that true independent S and A pronouns do not occur in the language. Instead, a set of complex elements each consisting of a person and tense/aspect marker exists (Newman 2000:485-6). Newman (2000:485-6) refers to the person markers as 'weak subject pronouns' and notes that these elements occur in two paradigms; the light and the heavy paradigms. The members of the light paradigm have been listed here as the representatives of the S and A forms in the language as they occur in a wider variety of contexts than the members of the heavy paradigm (Newman 2000:485-6). Finally, two possessive pronoun paradigms exist; one which is used with a masculine or plural possessum and another used exclusively with singular, feminine possessed nouns ending in '-a(a)' (Newman 2000:482). The paradigm used with masculine and plural possessed nouns is listed here.

The first person singular form listed here is used where the 'speaker is acting humble or polite', the second person form is utilized where the 'addressee is older or of higher status' while the third person form is used where the 'referent is (a) respected other' (Haiman 2011:184 ff). The remaining pronouns and their functions are described in detail by Haiman (2011:184 ff). 
332	332	Anong			Anong nung1282.csv		nung1282	Free	Owen Edwards	Particles marking the agent and object of a sentence exist in the language (Sun 2009:113 ff). While these elements may mark pronouns, the forms listed below exclude these markers. This is the case as these particles are considered distinct elements by Sun (2009:113 ff) and their appearance displays a degree of optionality dependent on the structure of the sentence (Sun 2009:113 ff). Tones: ˥ = 55, ˥˧ = 53, ˧ = 33, ˧˩ = 31, ˧˥ = 35

In addition to 'banla', 'zot' and 'zottu' may also function as 3rd personal plural pronouns (Baker 1972:72). 'zot' is used where a speaker refers to a group of people excluding him-/herself, while 'zottu' is used where a speaker refers to all members of a group excluding him-/herself (Baker 1972:72). Given the function of 'zottu' described above, in appropriate contexts this form may also be used in place of the 2nd person plural form 'zot' listed below.

The full set of inalienable possessive pronouns is described by Dixon (2004:77). In addition, the A, S, and O 3rd person plural forms are only used to refer to animate antecedents (Dixon 2004:77). The form used to refer to inanimates is, like the 3rd person singular forms, null (∅) (Dixon 2004:77).  
342	342	Crow			Crow crow1244.csv		crow1244	Free	Louise Baird	The forms entered here are treated as a verbal inflectional category in the grammar. There are no forms for 3rd person. The following is the justification provided for why they were chosen over the independent pronouns  to be presented in the database. Emphatic/contrastive pronoun stems exist in the language which function as A, S, and O forms and may occur as independent words in certain contexts (Graczyk 2007:60). However, these elements are frequently bound to some other element, always co-occur with bound pronominals, and have a highly specific emphatic function (Graczyk 2007:60). Thus, the non-emphatic bound pronominals that appear attached to the verb and typically serve to index pronominal features are given below as A, S, and O forms. In addition to this, the A and S forms listed only function as such with active verbs (Graczyk 2007:60). The subject of a stative verb is always represented by the appropriate O form listed below (Graczyk 2007:60). Also note, the Poss. forms listed index alienable possession only (Graczyk 2007:53). A set of distinct paradigms giving the forms for inalienable possession are discussed by Graczyk (2007:53 ff).
343	343	Inuktitut	West Greenlandic		Inuktitut (West Greenlandic) kala1399.csv		kala1399	Free	Oscar McLoughlin-Ning	There exist distinct inflectional paradigms for possessive marking of nouns for each case (Fortescue 1984:205 ff). In addition to this, distinct paradigms of possessive markers for singular and plural possessed elements exist (Fortescue 1984:207).

346	346	Pashto	Northern		Pashto (Northern) nort2646.csv		nort2646	Free	Oscar McLoughlin-Ning	The language displays split ergativity (David 2014:50). In the non-past tenses the language has nominative-accusative alignment while in the past tenses ergative-absolutive alignment is displayed. The forms inflected according to the nominative-accusative alignment are listed below. In addition, the forms listed are those used in eastern variants of the language. A wide range of other regional forms is described by David (2014:158-9). Finally, the 3rd person possessive forms only function as such when immediately preceded by the genitive prepositional element 'də' (David 2014:163).

Meakins and Nordlinger (2014:218) also list the form 'ŋaliwulaɲ' which is the possessive correspondent of 'ŋaliwula'.   
348	348	Hixkaryána			Hixkaryána hixk1239.csv		hixk1239	Free	Oscar McLoughlin-Ning	"There is no regular number marking system on nouns or pronouns in the language" (Derbyshire 1979:126). There is, however, a collective/non-collective distinction with the collective used where the 'focus is on a group' (Derbyshire 1979:126). These collective forms are listed below in the plural and dual entries of the paradigm while non-collective forms are listed in the singular entries. Additionally, Derbyshire (1979:96-7) describes a significant number of allomorphic variants of the possessive pronouns listed below while also noting that nominal suffixes (not listed below) which mark possessedness and number also distinguish between present and past possession (Derbyshire 1979:98-100). Finally, each of the animate third person A, S, and O pronouns have distinct non-deictic, near-deictic, medial-deictic, and remote-deictic forms (Derbyshire 1979:127). Pronouns used to refer to inanimates do not have distinct deictic and non-deictic forms (Derbyshire 1979:127). The animate non-deictic variants are listed below.

350	350	Northern Pumi	Northwest Yunnan		Northern Pumi (Northwest Yunnan) nort2723.csv		nort2723	Free		Noun phrases, including pronouns, are marked in a number of cases for semantic function (Ding 2014:138-9). These markings are treated by Ding (2014:138 ff) as postpositions, that is as objects morphosyntactically distinct from the element being marked. Thus the semantic role markers are not listed with the forms below. The one exception to this is the group of plural possessive pronouns in which the genitive postposition is incorporated into the pronoun (Ding 2014:166). In addition, distinct third person pronouns exist for present and absent referents (Ding 2014:90). The forms for present referents are listed. 
351	351	Neverver			Neverver ling1265.csv		ling1265	Free		An initial 'i-' may optionally occur attached to the the first and second person A, S, and O forms listed below (Barbour 2012:72). In addition to this, there is an allomorphic distinction between possessive pronouns that occur with initial 't-' and those that do not (the 'bare' forms) (Barbour 2012:136). The bare forms only occur following n-final nouns and and so the t-initial forms are listed below. Finally, the possessive forms listed below are used exclusively with human or sentient possessors (Barbour 2012:135). The two attested systems for the expression of non-human possession are discussed by Barbour (2012:141-6).

The first person singular form 'gua' listed below most commonly occurs in the speech of younger people and in informal situations (Sneddon 2006:59). The form 'saya' is the first person singular pronoun most favoured by older speakers (Sneddon 2006:59). In addition, the form 'gue' is described by Snedden (2006:59) as occurring in free variation with 'gua', although the latter form occurs more frequently in the speech of most people. In addition to this, the first person plural form 'kita' functions as both an exclusive and inclusive form with the Formal Indonesian exclusive pronoun 'kami' occurring very infrequently and often in a way that does not preserve its function as an exclusive pronoun (Sneddon 2006:62). With respect to the second person pronoun 'elu', a range of other forms, including a very seldom occurring set of exclusively plural second person forms, are also described by Sneddon (2006:64-6). Finally, the third person singular pronoun 'dia' can function as a plural form in a certain number of contexts although this usage is not typical for human referents (Sneddon 2006:67-8).

401	401	Kiowa			Kiowa kiow1266.csv		kiow1266	Free	Oscar McLoughlin-Ning	There are no third person personal pronouns in the language, instead demonstrative pronouns serve this function (Adger et al. 2008:18). The third person forms listed below are variants of the distal demonstrative pronoun. 
402	402	Kaonde			Kaonde kaon1241.csv		kaon1241	Free		Every noun in the language belongs to one of 18 noun classes. Class membership is (typically) determined by the attachment of a prefix to an invariant stem that carries the lexical meaning of the noun. Third person pronominal reference is achieved through the attachment of a prefix to the verbal complex that signals the noun class of the referent as well as the referent's grammatical function in the sentence (Wright 2008:9-10). The third person singular forms listed below are drawn from the class 1 prefix set while the third person plural forms are drawn from the plural associate of class 1, class 2. This is the case as class 1 and 2 contain words such as 'person/people' and other terms for human and animate entities (Wright 2008:9-10).

In place of third person forms, definite proximate animate demonstratives are listed below, see Zigmond et al. (1990:46) for description of the complete set of demonstrative pronouns. 
407	407	Tswana			Tswana tswa1253.csv		tswa1253	Free		The language possesses distinct third person pronouns for each of its nine noun classes (Cole 1955:128). The third person forms listed below are associated with class one referents. See Cole (1955:128) for the full list of third person pronouns. Additionally, possessive pronouns are complex elements formed by the combination of a bound pronominal base and a prefixal 'concord' that cross-references the possessum (Cole 1955:159-62). Only the pronominal bases are listed below, see Cole (1955:159-60) for a full list of the possessive concords. Finally, Cole (1955:162) lists 'communal' plural possessive bases in the first, second, and third person (class one) which are not listed below. 
408	408	Yoruba			Yoruba yoru1245.csv		yoru1245	Free		The third person singular object pronoun takes the form of the vowel of the verb (Bamgbose 1966:106). Thus, the numeral '0' is listed in the relevant cells as a place holder. In addition to this, the '.' placed initially in the first and second person singular possessive forms listed below represents a floating low tone (Bamgbose 1966:106). Finally, a number of variations in form of the pronouns listed below are noted by Bamgbose (1966:105-6).
409	409	Tauya			Tauya tauy1241.csv		tauy1241	Free		The object forms listed appear as proclitics attached to transitive verbs (MacDonald 2013:7). In addition, third person singular objects and possessors are typically unmarked in the language (MacDonald 2013:7). Hence, the numeral '0' has been entered in the relevant cells below.
410	410	North Marquesan			North Marquesan nort2845.csv		nort2845	Free		When occurring as a grammatical object, personal pronouns are preceded by the object/oblique marking preposition 'iɑ' (Cablitz 2006:101). This element is not included in the object forms listed below as it is analysed and glossed by Cablitz (2006) as distinct from the set of personal pronouns. In addition, other than the second person singular and first person singular possessive forms listed below, no special possessive pronouns exist (Cablitz 2006:101). Rather, the possessive use of pronouns is marked periphrastically using the S/A/O forms as discussed in detail by Cablitz (2006:167 ff). 
411	411	Kham (Western Parbate)	Takale		Kham (Western Parbate) (Takale) west2420.csv		west2420	Free		Per Watters (2002:161), the S, A, and O forms listed below are used only 'to reintroduce [discourse] participants of low standing or to place special emphasis on the participant at hand'. A set of bound pronominal elements serve to mark anaphoric reference in a manner comparable to the function of free pronouns in English and similar languages (Watters 2002:161). In addition, the language possesses a complex system of case marking in which both ergative-absolutive and nominative-accusative patterns of marking exist and overlap (Watters 2002:68 ff). This overlapping of case marking patterns is so extensive that utterances which contain both an ergative agent and accusative object or an unmarked nominative subject and unmarked absolutive object can occur (Watters 2002:68 ff). Which marking an argument receives is determined by its position on a nominal hierarchy in relation to the other arguments present in the clause (Watters 2002:68-9). Given this state of affairs and the lack of any obvious default marking for arguments appearing in the S, A or O roles, the pronouns below are given without any such markings. The 3rd person forms are transparently relatable to the distal (within view) demonstrative.

The animate, proximate, visible third person forms are listed below. The element 'úja' appears immediately following A pronouns (Payne 2012:68). Since this element is classified as a postposition it is not included in the forms listed below. Possession is marked differently for inalienable and alienable nouns (Payne 2013:74 ff). The forms used for inalienable possession are listed below. Note, the forms of the prefixal possessive pronouns listed below vary significantly in an allomorphic fashion as discussed by Payne (2013:74-5). 
414	414	Tariana		ICR OMN	Tariana [ICR OMN] tari1256.csv		tari1256	Free	Oscar McLoughlin-Ning	The O forms listed below are formed from the A, S, and P forms by attachment of the suffix '-nɑ'. This suffix is in fact only used for non-topical pronouns in the O function while '-nuku/-nɑku' is the suffix used for topical O pronouns (Aikhenvald 2006:139). In addition to this, the A, S, and P forms listed below are those used in non-focused contexts (Aikhenvald 2006:139). The forms used for focused constituents carry the suffix '-nhe/-ne'  (Aikhenvald 2006:139). Finally, feminine forms of the plural pronouns listed below, which are unmarked for gender, are formed by attachment of the suffix '-mɑpe' (Aikhenvald 2006:177).

419	419	Sãotomense 			Sãotomense  saot1239.csv		saot1239	Free	Oscar McLoughlin-Ning	The free first person singular A, S pronoun 'aˈmi' listed below most commonly occurs before non-verbal elements; the use of this form before verbs is considered archaic (Ferraz 1979:63-4). Most commonly, before verbs a bound morpheme 'N-', a nasal homorganic with the initial consonant of the verb, (or one of the elements in free variation with this morpheme) is used (Ferraz 1979:63-4). Similarly, the third person singular A, S pronoun 'e' listed below only occurs before verbs with the form 'eˈle' used before all other categories of word, while the first person singular O pronoun 'mũ' only occurs before verbs with the form 'ami' used before all other categories (Ferraz 1979:64).

In addition, note that 'informal' 1SG and 2SG also exist in addition to the forms listed below (Othman and Atmosumarto 1995:232). 
433	433	Rapa Nui			Rapa Nui rapa1244.csv		rapa1244	Free	Oscar McLoughlin-Ning	A series of syntactic function marking particles exist in the language, however this is not analysed as involving affixation (Du Feu 1996:112-4). Hence, in all cases function marking particles have not been reproduced below. In addition, the language makes a distinction between definite/indefinite and, in the singular, alienable/inalienable pronominal possession (De Feu 1996:144-5). The possessive forms listed below are the definite pronouns used for alienable possession. 
434	434	Sinaugoro			Sinaugoro sina1266.csv		sina1266	Free	Louise Baird	In addition to the forms listed below, complex pronominal phrases incorporating plural pronouns that carry a dual or trial meaning that may serve the S/A/O function are also possible, see Tauberschmidt (1999:21) for discussion. Additionally, two distinct patterns of pronominal possession exist: the inalienable and the alienable (Tauberschmidt 1999:59-60). Inalienable possession is marked by attachment of a pronominal suffix to the possessum which indexes the person and number of the possessor (Tauberschmidt 1999:59-60). Nouns and noun phrases that are possessed in an alienable fashion are immediately preceded by a possessive pronoun that also indexes the number and person of the possessor as well as whether the possessum is edible or not (what Tauberschmidt 1999:60-61 terms a neutral/edible distinction). In all cases the possessive construction may be preceded by the S/A/O pronoun that indexes the number and person of the possessor. The possessive pronouns used in neutral alienable possessive contexts are listed below, see Tauberschmidt (1999:19-20) for inalienable possessive suffixes and the edible alienable possessive pronouns.
435	435	Big Nambas			Big Nambas bign1238.csv		bign1238	Free	Oscar McLoughlin-Ning	The language makes a distinction between obligatorily and optionally possessed nouns (Fox 1979:23-30). The possessive personal suffixes used with the majority of optionally possessed nouns are listed below. Note however, a small number of optionally possessed nouns (enumerated by Fox 1979:26) do not take the possessive suffixes listed but rather are preceded by the appropriately inflected form of the possessive adjective /nan/ ('his').  Obligatorily possessed nouns take a set of personal possessive suffixes otherwise identical to those listed below except that the initial segment /a/ is absent (Fox 1979:25). 
436	436	Ura			Ura urav1235.csv		urav1235	Free	Oscar McLoughlin-Ning	All plural pronouns listed below may optionally carry the suffix /-ye/ which has the effect of adding a meaning similar to every. Hence, while /gimi/ simply means 'you (pl.)', /gimi-ye/ means roughly 'all of you (pl.)' (Crowley 1999:127). Note also, /y/ represents what is termed by Crowley (1999:106) an 'alveolar glide'.

In addition, singular possessive pronouns in this language agree with the possessum in gender and number while plural possessives agree in number only (Highfield 1979:62-3). The possessive forms listed below are those used with a singular masculine possessum, see Highfield (1979:62-3) for complete description of the possessive forms. Many possessive forms also have a morphophonemic alternant, see again Highfield (1979:62-3) for discussion.

441	441	Maori			Maori maor1246.csv		maor1246	Free	Louise Baird	In all clause types A and S pronouns appear unmarked while O pronouns are marked by the preposition /i/ (Harlow 1996:27). Since /i/ is not analysed as incorporated into the head of the marked object phrase, this element has not been included with the O forms listed below. In addition, when acting as possessives, the forms listed below appear following one of four possessive prepositions and immediately precede the possessed noun phrase (Harlow 1996:20-2). Each of the four possessive prepositions index a certain form of possession as discussed by Harlow (1996:20-2).
442	442	Mangarayi			Mangarayi mang1381.csv		mang1381	Free	Oscar McLoughlin-Ning	Demonstrative pronouns, which mark a 'distant/non-distant' distinction, are used in place of third person S, A, and O personal pronouns (Merlan 1989:99). The third person forms listed below are the non-distant forms, see Merlan (1989:107 ff) for a full discussion of all demonstrative pronouns and the properties of the distance distinction. In addition to this, in all persons trial forms exist for all functions S, A, O, and Poss. See Merlan (1989:102) for the first and second person nominative (= S and A) and accusative ( = O) trial forms, Merlan (1989:110) for the third person (= demonstrative) nominative (= S and A) and accusative (= O) trial forms, and Merlan (1989:106) for the trial possessives. 
443	443	Vaeakau-Taumako			Vaeakau-Taumako pile1238.csv		pile1238	Free	Oscar McLoughlin-Ning	The forms listed below are given in the system of transcription adopted by Næss (2000). In this system /lh/ represents what is terms an 'aspirated lateral' (Næss 2000:7) while vowels carrying a macron are long (Næss 2000:10). In addition, the language marks a distinction between 'o-possession' and 'a-possession' (see Næss 2000:17 for a discussion of the import of this distinction). In the former case the possessive pronoun is preceded by the possessive preposition /o/ and in the latter case by /a/. Although a number of the possessive forms listed below are given in Næss (2000:34) as a single word incorporating the preceding possessive preposition, in all cases the preposition has been excluded from the forms listed below. Finally, also note, in addition to the possessive forms listed below, which follow the possessed noun, a set of pre-nominal free possessives as well as a set of possessive suffixes exist, see Næss (2000:35-8) for these forms alongside associated discussion of their use and distribution.

445	445	Mewati			Mewati mewa1250.csv		mewa1250	Free		In the analysis of Gusain (2003:19-20), the third person forms listed below are in fact best considered demonstratives. In addition to this, all pronouns of the language may appear in two case forms, the 'direct' and the 'oblique' (Gusain 2003:19-20). When functioning as S, A or O the pronouns appear in the 'direct' case. On the other hand, all possessors including pronominals appear in the oblique case and are marked periphrastically by one of a set of possessive postpositions which each index a certain type of possessive relation (see Gusain 2003:23 for discussion). 
446	446	Lingala			Lingala ling1263.csv		ling1263	Free		The forms listed below are given in the system of transcription adopted by Meeuwis (2010). In addition, when functioning as possessives, the pronouns listed appear immediately following the unbound connective element /na/ which in turn immediately follows the possessed noun (Meeuwis 2010:59).  
447	447	Chichewa			Chichewa nyan1308.csv		nyan1308	Free		The forms listed are given the system of transcription adopted by Bentley and Kulemeka (2001). In addition, when functioning as possessives the forms below precede the possessed noun and are marked by a free morpheme that agrees with the possessed noun in number and gender (Bentley and Kulemeka 2001:14).
448	448	Yeyi			Yeyi yeyi1239.csv		yeyi1239	Free		The forms listed below are given in the system of transcription used by Seidel (2008). In addition to the A, S, and O forms listed below, a paradigm of monosyllabic personal pronouns also exists, see Seidel (2008:168 ff) for these forms and attendant discussion. Also note, the possessive forms listed below are bound stems that index the person or, in the case of third person referents, the noun class of the possessor (Seidel 2008:163). These forms are obligatorily marked with an prefixal concord morpheme which indexes the noun class of the possessum (Seidel 2008:163). Related to this, note that the third person possessive forms listed below are in fact the possessive stems used for class 1 nouns (terms for humans) while the third person plural forms are the stems used for class 2 nouns (one of the plural associates of class 1). Finally, an additional paradigm of 'complex possessive' forms also exists, see Seidel (2008:166 ff) for discussion of the form and function of the elements of this paradigm. 
449	449	Ekegusii 			Ekegusii  gusi1247.csv		gusi1247	Free		The forms listed below are given in a phonemic transcription using the system of transcription adopted by Cammenga (2002). Chapter two of Cammenga (2002) contains extensive discussion of phonological rules which account for the surface realisation of the forms listed below. In addition, note that possessive pronouns agree with the possessed noun in noun class and the possessor in number and person (Cammenga 2002:329-32). The forms listed below are those used with class one possessed nouns. See Cammenga (2002:329-31) for a complete statement of the forms for possessed nouns of all classes.

Specifically, note that while /r/ represents an alveolar tap/trill, as in the IPA, /ɾ/ here represents what is described as a 'voiced apico-dentialveolar tap with a distinct palatal resonance' (Asher and Kumari 1997:418). Also note, the languages possesses 3S and 3PL neuter pronouns in all case forms (Asher and Kumari 1997:258-64) which are not listed below. In addition, while there is a gender distinction between 3S masculine (Gender 1 below) and 3S feminine (Gender 2) pronouns this distinction does not exist for 3PL forms with the sole gender distinction being that between shared masculine/feminine forms and neuter forms (Asher and Kumari 1997:258-64).

457	457	Daasanach			Daasanach daas1238.csv		daas1238	Free	Oscar McLoughlin-Ning	The forms listed below are given in the system of transcription employed by Tosco (2001). In addition, note that the third person O form /ʰí/ listed below is, in the terminology of Tosco (2001), a 'Verbal' pronoun that only functions as a third person O form where a nominal object has been left dislocated for pragmatic or syntactic reasons (Tosco 2001:221). In this case /ʰí/ appears in the position from which the object has been 'moved' (Tosco 2001:221). Where no left dislocation occurs, Tosco (2001:221) suggests that (apparently) generic nouns such as /mí/ ('man') serve the function of third person object pronouns. Despite this, Tosco (2001) does not provide discussion that is sufficiently explicit to allow for the determination of precisely what forms are used in place of third person O pronouns, which are listed as absent in the paradigm of 'Object' pronouns (Tosco 2001:211). Thus, subject to future review, /ʰí/ is listed below in order to fill all cells. Finally, the forms listed by Tosco (2001:210-14) as the 'Subject' pronouns are given below as the A/S forms. These pronouns may only appear in what Tosco (2001) terms 'Topicalised' sentences with a 'Perfect' or 'Dependent' verbal form. While elements of two other sets of pronouns may also function as A/S pronouns with other verbal forms (see Tosco 2001:210-14 for discussion), 'Perfect' verbal forms are by far the most common in the language and are 'used for any action unless it is specifically describing an event that has not yet occurred at the time of utterance' (Tosco 2001:264). Hence, the 'Subject' pronouns are reproduced below as the most commonly occurring elements that may serve the A/S function.

663	663	Welsh		ICR NE	Welsh [ICR NE] wels1247.csv		wels1247	Free	Nick Evans	General comment wrt possessive series: in addition to an element preceding the possessed noun (e.f. fy '1sg POSS', dy '2sg POSS', the basic form of the pronoun may optionally follow, in addition. Cf plant 'children', dy blant 'your (intim.) children' but also dy blant di.  There are a number of variants of most pronouns. Here I have entered the commonest variant, favouring the unreduced form where there is a choice, e.g. fy instead of 'y for the 1sg Poss. There are also dialectal variants, e.g. e vs o for the 3sg masc. I have chosen just one of these to enter, namely the e series. Forms are given in standard Welsh orthography; non-standard values are: <f> = /v/, <ff> = /f/, <ch> = /x/, <ng> = /ŋ/, <y> = /ɨ/, <w> = /u/, <dd>= /ð/, <ll >= /ɬ/. TIme taken to enter: 45 minutes (split between reading grammar and systematising notes out of it, then entering data. Some forms trigger a following 'soft mutation' – basically changing voiceless stops to voiced stops, voiced stops to voiced fricatives , and /m/ to /v/ <f>. Since the presence vs absence of a soft-mutation trigger can distinguish forms in the paradigm (e.g. 3sg  masc poss vs 3sg fem poss), it is shown here by a º after the form. 
664	664	Burarra		ICR NE	Burarra [ICR NE] bura1267.csv		bura1267	Free	Nick Evans	1. Not all questions could be fully answered from this source and it will be worth checking the Glasgows' dictionary for followup on some forms 2. I have converted Green's practical orthography into IPA symbols 3. Green analyses Burarra as having a minimal/unit-augmented/augmented system rather than a singular/dual/plural system. At the only point where this generates ambiguity in the mapping (12pl, which could be either 12ua or 12a) I have entered both forms 4. There is a gender distinction (masc vs fem) just in the unit augmented forms (typologically very unusual to have it here but not in the singular/minimal). This is invisible to our coding since we only allow for gender in the singular 6. Within possessive pronouns, there is an 'oblique' set for possession of kin, and a regular 'possessive adjective' set. I have entered the latter only, since they are less restricted in application. Possessive adjectives agree in gender with the possessum. Here I have given the neuter-agreement forms, since they are what is exemplified. The grammar states the rules but does not give all the forms, so these have been constructed according to the rules set out in the grammar. (would be worth checking the Glasgows' dictionary to see if the forms are there)

669	669	Cora		ICR NE	Cora [ICR NE] elna1235.csv		elna1235	Free	Nick Evans	The orthography used in the source is an Americanist one, which I have converted to more standard IPA symbols. In particular, <c> > ʦ, <ny> > ɲ, <ty> > c. Acute accents indicate tone and have been retained; doubled vowel letters indicate length. There are a number of different slots, each with their own form: subject prefixes, subject particles, pausal subjects, and independent subjects. Likewise for possessors there are both bound and free forms. Here we use the independent subject forms, and the independent object forms, which also function as possessor markers. This analytic distinction affects the pattern of syncretism, since distinctions are made in the bound forms (e.g. 2sgO mwa- is distinct from 2sg possessor a-) which are not made in the free forms (mwéeʦi would cover both 2sgO and 2sgPoss). Should we decide to go back and include the bound forms, they are on p. 297. There are no specialised third person pronouns, these being shown by demonstratives (p. 245, 297). The 'there' form is chosen here as it appears to be the most neutral in discourse, and in any case the paterning of syncretism is independent of which form is chosen. Here again there are some tricky decisions, with different forms for both preverbal and postverbal: I have entered just the postverbal forms, since that is the only position available to subject, object and possessor alike, across all number values: for some reason no form is given for plural pre-verbal forms.
