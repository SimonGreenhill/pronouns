This overlapping of case marking patterns is so extensive that utterances which contain both an ergative agent and accusative object or an unmarked nominative subject and unmarked absolutive object can occur (Watters 2002:68 ff).

In this system /lh/ represents what is terms an 'aspirated lateral' (Næss 2000:7) while vowels carrying a macron are long (Næss 2000:10). In addition, the language marks a distinction between 'o-possession' and 'a-possession' (see Næss 2000:17 for a discussion of the import of this distinction). In the former case the possessive pronoun is preceded by the possessive preposition /o/ and in the latter case by /a/. Although a number of the possessive forms listed below are given in Næss (2000:34) as a single word incorporating the preceding possessive preposition, in all cases the preposition has been excluded from the forms listed below. Finally, also note, in addition to the possessive forms listed below, which follow the possessed noun, a set of pre-nominal free possessives as well as a set of possessive suffixes exist, see Næss (2000:35-8) for these forms alongside associated discussion of their use and distribution.

In addition, note that the third person O form /ʰí/ listed below is, in the terminology of Tosco (2001), a 'Verbal' pronoun that only functions as a third person O form where a nominal object has been left dislocated for pragmatic or syntactic reasons (Tosco 2001:221). In this case /ʰí/ appears in the position from which the object has been 'moved' (Tosco 2001:221). Where no left dislocation occurs, Tosco (2001:221) suggests that (apparently) generic nouns such as /mí/ ('man') serve the function of third person object pronouns. Despite this, Tosco (2001) does not provide discussion that is sufficiently explicit to allow for the determination of precisely what forms are used in place of third person O pronouns, which are listed as absent in the paradigm of 'Object' pronouns (Tosco 2001:211). Thus, subject to future review, /ʰí/ is listed below in order to fill all cells. Finally, the forms listed by Tosco (2001:210-14) as the 'Subject' pronouns are given below as the A/S forms. These pronouns may only appear in what Tosco (2001) terms 'Topicalised' sentences with a 'Perfect' or 'Dependent' verbal form. While elements of two other sets of pronouns may also function as A/S pronouns with other verbal forms (see Tosco 2001:210-14 for discussion), 'Perfect' verbal forms are by far the most common in the language and are 'used for any action unless it is specifically describing an event that has not yet occurred at the time of utterance' (Tosco 2001:264). Hence, the 'Subject' pronouns are reproduced below as the most commonly occurring elements that may serve the A/S function. ",Free,Oscar McLoughlin-Ning

Cf plant 'children', dy blant 'your (intim.) children' but also dy blant di.  There are a number of variants of most pronouns. Here I have entered the commonest variant, favouring the unreduced form where there is a choice, e.g. fy instead of 'y for the 1sg Poss. There are also dialectal variants, e.g. e vs o for the 3sg masc. I have chosen just one of these to enter, namely the e series. Forms are given in standard Welsh orthography; non-standard values are: <f> = /v/, <ff> = /f/, <ch> = /x/, <ng> = /ŋ/, <y> = /ɨ/, <w> = /u/, <dd>= /ð/, <ll >= /ɬ/. TIme taken to enter: 45 minutes (split between reading grammar and systematising notes out of it, then entering data. Some forms trigger a following 'soft mutation' – basically changing voiceless stops to voiced stops, voiced stops to voiced fricatives , and /m/ to /v/ <f>. Since the presence vs absence of a soft-mutation trigger can distinguish forms in the paradigm (e.g. 3sg  masc poss vs 3sg fem poss), it is shown here by a º after the form. ",Free,Nick Evans

Not all questions could be fully answered from this source and it will be worth checking the Glasgows' dictionary for followup on some forms 2. I have converted Green's practical orthography into IPA symbols 3. Green analyses Burarra as having a minimal/unit-augmented/augmented system rather than a singular/dual/plural system. At the only point where this generates ambiguity in the mapping (12pl, which could be either 12ua or 12a) I have entered both forms 4. There is a gender distinction (masc vs fem) just in the unit augmented forms (typologically very unusual to have it here but not in the singular/minimal). This is invisible to our coding since we only allow for gender in the singular 6. Within possessive pronouns, there is an 'oblique' set for possession of kin, and a regular 'possessive adjective' set. I have entered the latter only, since they are less restricted in application. Possessive adjectives agree in gender with the possessum. Here I have given the neuter-agreement forms, since they are what is exemplified. The grammar states the rules but does not give all the forms, so these have been constructed according to the rules set out in the grammar.

In particular, <c> > ʦ, <ny> > ɲ, <ty> > c. Acute accents indicate tone and have been retained; doubled vowel letters indicate length. There are a number of different slots, each with their own form: subject prefixes, subject particles, pausal subjects, and independent subjects. Likewise for possessors there are both bound and free forms. Here we use the independent subject forms, and the independent object forms, which also function as possessor markers. This analytic distinction affects the pattern of syncretism, since distinctions are made in the bound forms (e.g. 2sgO mwa- is distinct from 2sg possessor a-) which are not made in the free forms (mwéeʦi would cover both 2sgO and 2sgPoss). Should we decide to go back and include the bound forms, they are on p. 297. There are no specialised third person pronouns, these being shown by demonstratives (p. 245, 297). The 'there' form is chosen here as it appears to be the most neutral in discourse, and in any case the paterning of syncretism is independent of which form is chosen. Here again there are some tricky decisions, with different forms for both preverbal and postverbal: I have entered just the postverbal forms, since that is the only position available to subject, object and possessor alike, across all number values: for some reason no form is given for plural pre-verbal forms.
