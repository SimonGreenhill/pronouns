I've retained only the patient bound pronouns (for S and P). Charlotte is right in entering both patent and actor forms for S; the language works on an actor/undergoer basis. I've selected the inalienable forms for possessors. (Alienable forms are idenical except any form with /a/ has /e/ instead.

""The free pronouns serve to express or co-index Actor (A) arguments. (...) [T]he bound pronouns are prefixed to nouns and verbs. Bound pronouns are divided into three formally distinct sets. Pronominal prefixes are polysemous. They combine with verbs to express the Undergoer (U) arguments and with nouns to express possessors."" For an overview of the sets and their menings, see Kratochvíl (2007: 76--77). ""The single participant of the intransitive verb may be realized as the A or U argument.""

The pronominal prefixes mark inalienable possession (Haan 2001: 38) and the objects of some verbs. Other verbs use the accusative free pronouns (with -ri) for their objects (ibid.: 46). As for the free pronouns that mark (alienable) possession, ""[s]emantically, both types of genitive pronouns express possession. The difference, however, is that a genitive pronoun marked e, while expressing possession, also expresses emphasis or contrast. I shall call it a ‘contrastive’ genitive pronoun. A genitive pronoun marked ɔ does not express emphasis or contrast. Therefore I call it a ‘non-contrastive’ genitive pronoun."" (ibid.: 163)."

The paradigm below follows the following statement: ""The object prefixes have animate referents (humans or animals), the object pronouns may be used to refer to both animate and inanimate objects"" (Klamer 2010: 78). This does not entirely match, however, with Klamer's statement elsewhere: ""For third person referents, a free pronoun is used if it is inanimate. If it is animate, it is expressed with a verbal prefix, and an optional additional NP."" (ibid.: 166-167). The third person plural ""[i]'in and gi'in refer to a group of people outside the phyiscal and/or narrative context, translated as `elsewhere' here. In practice, the use of these pronouns typically implies that the speaker cannot see the referents because they are at a different location, or existed at a different time."" (ibid.: 79). ""Teiwa has a set of dual pronouns that can be used to encode subjects and to conjoin nominals."" (ibid.: 82). It seems, however, that the `plural' forms are generally used to refer to two participants, hence their presence in the `dual' boxes as well.

(Reesink 1987: 109) -- I assume that plural inanimate possessors are also referred to with a singular form (C vT).
Objects are marked by object prefixes on verbs. There is no 3sg object prefix and therefore ""The free third person singular pronoun may also fill the object position, but as such it is not a verbal prefix."" (p51)"

(...) The seris II type of this pronoun (e) is put between brackets because I have never met it in actual usage, while my informants were divided in their opinions on the point.""

I hope I have interpreted Cowan (1965: 16) well as concerns the dəjɛ (etc) vs. the da (etc) series. The da series can be used with postpositions -- I do not know if they are obligatorily followed by postpositions when they are O."

Emphatic/contrastive pronoun stems exist in the language which function as A, S, and O forms and may occur as independent words in certain contexts (Graczyk 2007:60). However, these elements are frequently bound to some other element, always co-occur with bound pronominals, and have a highly specific emphatic function (Graczyk 2007:60).

The third person singular forms listed below are drawn from the class 1 prefix set while the third person plural forms are drawn from the plural associate of class 1, class 2.

A set of bound pronominal elements serve to mark anaphoric reference in a manner comparable to the function of free pronouns in English and similar languages (Watters 2002:161). 

In addition, the language possesses a complex system of case marking in which both ergative-absolutive and nominative-accusative patterns of marking exist and overlap (Watters 2002:68 ff). This overlapping of case marking patterns is so extensive that utterances which contain both an ergative agent and accusative object or an unmarked nominative subject and unmarked absolutive object can occur (Watters 2002:68 ff). Which marking an argument receives is determined by its position on a nominal hierarchy in relation to the other arguments present in the clause (Watters 2002:68-9).

In addition to the A, S, and O forms listed below, a paradigm of monosyllabic personal pronouns also exists, see Seidel (2008:168 ff) for these forms and attendant discussion. Also note, the possessive forms listed below are bound stems that index the person or, in the case of third person referents, the noun class of the possessor (Seidel 2008:163). These forms are obligatorily marked with an prefixal concord morpheme which indexes the noun class of the possessum (Seidel 2008:163). Related to this, note that the third person possessive forms listed below are in fact the possessive stems used for class 1 nouns (terms for humans) while the third person plural forms are the stems used for class 2 nouns (one of the plural associates of class 1). Finally, an additional paradigm of 'complex possessive' forms also exists, see Seidel (2008:166 ff) for discussion of the form and function of the elements of this paradigm."

Specifically, note that while /r/ represents an alveolar tap/trill, as in the IPA, /ɾ/ here represents what is described as a 'voiced apico-dentialveolar tap with a distinct palatal resonance' (Asher and Kumari 1997:418). Also note, the languages possesses 3S and 3PL neuter pronouns in all case forms (Asher and Kumari 1997:258-64) which are not listed below. In addition, while there is a gender distinction between 3S masculine (Gender 1 below) and 3S feminine (Gender 2) pronouns this distinction does not exist for 3PL forms with the sole gender distinction being that between shared masculine/feminine forms and neuter forms (Asher and Kumari 1997:258-64)."

457,daasanach,F,,tosco-2001,"The forms listed below are given in the system of transcription employed by Tosco (2001). In addition, note that the third person O form /ʰí/ listed below is, in the terminology of Tosco (2001), a 'Verbal' pronoun that only functions as a third person O form where a nominal object has been left dislocated for pragmatic or syntactic reasons (Tosco 2001:221). In this case /ʰí/ appears in the position from which the object has been 'moved' (Tosco 2001:221). Where no left dislocation occurs, Tosco (2001:221) suggests that (apparently) generic nouns such as /mí/ ('man') serve the function of third person object pronouns. Despite this, Tosco (2001) does not provide discussion that is sufficiently explicit to allow for the determination of precisely what forms are used in place of third person O pronouns, which are listed as absent in the paradigm of 'Object' pronouns (Tosco 2001:211). Thus, subject to future review, /ʰí/ is listed below in order to fill all cells. Finally, the forms listed by Tosco (2001:210-14) as the 'Subject' pronouns are given below as the A/S forms. These pronouns may only appear in what Tosco (2001) terms 'Topicalised' sentences with a 'Perfect' or 'Dependent' verbal form. While elements of two other sets of pronouns may also function as A/S pronouns with other verbal forms (see Tosco 2001:210-14 for discussion), 'Perfect' verbal forms are by far the most common in the language and are 'used for any action unless it is specifically describing an event that has not yet occurred at the time of utterance' (Tosco 2001:264). Hence, the 'Subject' pronouns are reproduced below as the most commonly occurring elements that may serve the A/S function."

663,welsh-icr-ne,,,king-2003,"General comment wrt possessive series: in addition to an element preceding the possessed noun (e.f. fy '1sg POSS', dy '2sg POSS', the basic form of the pronoun may optionally follow, in addition. Cf plant 'children', dy blant 'your (intim.) children' but also dy blant di. 
There are a number of variants of most pronouns. Here I have entered the commonest variant, favouring the unreduced form where there is a choice, e.g. fy instead of 'y for the 1sg Poss. There are also dialectal variants, e.g. e vs o for the 3sg masc. I have chosen just one of these to enter, namely the e series.
Forms are given in standard Welsh orthography; non-standard values are: <f> = /v/, <ff> = /f/, <ch> = /x/, <ng> = /ŋ/, <y> = /ɨ/, <w> = /u/, <dd>= /ð/, <ll >= /ɬ/.
TIme taken to enter: 45 minutes (split between reading grammar and systematising notes out of it, then entering data.
Some forms trigger a following 'soft mutation' – basically changing voiceless stops to voiced stops, voiced stops to voiced fricatives , and /m/ to /v/ <f>. Since the presence vs absence of a soft-mutation trigger can distinguish forms in the paradigm (e.g. 3sg  masc poss vs 3sg fem poss), it is shown here by a º after the form."
664,burarra,,,green-1987,"1. Not all questions could be fully answered from this source and it will be worth checking the Glasgows' dictionary for followup on some forms
2. I (NE) forgot to add -ICR-NE after the language name and now can't see how to do that
3. I have converted Green's practical orthography into IPA symbols
4. Green analyses Burarra as having a minimal/unit-augmented/augmented system rather than a singular/dual/plural system. At the only point where this generates ambiguity in the mapping (12pl, which could be either 12ua or 12a) I have entered both forms
5. There is a gender distinction (masc vs fem) just in the unit augmented forms (typologically very unusual to have it here but not in the singular/minimal). This is invisible to our coding since we only allow for gender in the singular
6. Within possessive pronouns, there is an 'oblique' set for possession of kin, and a regular 'possessive adjective' set. I have entered the latter only, since they are less restricted in application. Possessive adjectives agree in gender with the possessum. Here I have given the neuter-agreement forms, since they are what is exemplified. The grammar states the rules but does not give all the forms, so these have been constructed according to the rules set out in the grammar. (would be worth checking the Glasgows' dictionary to see if the forms are there)"

There are a number of different slots, each with their own form: subject prefixes, subject particles, pausal subjects, and independent subjects. Likewise for possessors there are both bound and free forms. Here we use the independent subject forms, and the independent object forms, which also function as possessor markers. This analytic distinction affects the pattern of syncretism, since distinctions are made in the bound forms (e.g. 2sgO mwa- is distinct from 2sg possessor a-) which are not made in the free forms (mwéeʦi would cover both 2sgO and 2sgPoss). Should we decide to go back and include the bound forms, they are on p. 297.
There are no specialised third person pronouns, these being shown by demonstratives (p. 245, 297). The 'there' form is chosen here as it appears to be the most neutral in discourse, and in any case the paterning of syncretism is independent of which form is chosen. Here again there are some tricky decisions, with different forms for both preverbal and postverbal: I have entered just the postverbal forms, since that is the only position available to subject, object and possessor alike, across all number values: for some reason no form is given for plural pre-verbal forms."
